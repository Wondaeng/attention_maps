# Are attention maps a solution to the interpretability crisis in AI-assisted medical imaging?

This repository contains the implementation of the project _"Are attention maps a solution to the interpretability crisis in AI-assisted medical imaging?"_. In this project, we investigated the reliability of attention maps of the Vision Transformer (ViT) as an interpretability methods under the context of medical image diagnosis. This repository provides reproducible Python codes to generate interpretability results of attention maps and two different methods: [Grad-CAM](https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam) and the [Chefer method](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability).
